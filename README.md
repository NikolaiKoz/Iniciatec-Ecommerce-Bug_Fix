# BugFix

BugFix is an e-commerce project for the Inciatec - Accenture bootcamp. The team members chose the theme of a computer store, this page is inspired by e-sports and the gamer theme.

In this project we had to use HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, but our educators gave us freedom to use any framework or library we wanted.

    The projects are carried out with hundreds of tools, languages and hours of work, but the most important thing for us is the passion for web development.
